### Welcome to the 2848 Scouting App Homepage
Our goal in this application is to make a simplistic and easy way to scout and keep track of competition while the application does the heavy lifting. Our finishing goal and hope is that the app will not only crack down on time also create new and significant ways to view information such as percentages and even predicting upcoming matches. This application is currently being created, including GUI, by @ianwinson, @rmdevoe, and @GreenLED99. Good luck in this season... We'll see you there.
