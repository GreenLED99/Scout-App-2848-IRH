Our finishing goal and hope is that the app will not only crack down on time also create new and significant ways to view information such as percentages and even predicting upcoming matches. This application is currently being created, including GUI, by @ianwinson, @rmdevoe, and @GreenLED99. Good luck in this season... We'll see you there. \r\n\r\n[VISIT US HERE](http://team2848.com/)\r\n\r\n`GLHF`","google":"UA-73379060-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
